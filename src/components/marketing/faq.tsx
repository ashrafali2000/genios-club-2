                  GeniosClub will remain stable even if it increases in size a
                  thousandfold. GeniosClub does not create debts or other
                  obligations. GeniosClub is a next-gen crowdfunding platform
                  and has nothing to do with pyramid schemes. The principle of a
                  pyramid scheme is that a large portion of the money is
                  concentrated in the hands of its creators. The earlier you
                  arrive, the more you earn. A pyramid scheme can be closed at
                  any time. Members of the GeniosClub platform, both leaders and
                  newcomers, are on equal terms. No one can terminate the
                  platforms operation, since its functionality is ensured by a
                  smart contract, which cannot be erased or altered. Even if the
                  website ceases to function, all the data and the entire
                  structure will remain intact, and the smart contract will
                  continue to function, as long as there is electricity and
                  internet access.

                  There are no risks on the GeniosClub platform since there is
                  no expiration date on the levels you have adquired. The
                  platform works on the basis of a smart contract in a

                  to you and you alone, and you can use the money as you like as
                  soon as it is in your wallet.
