              We are building a 5 lines spillover system, there is an overflow
              from above and from below. The partners in your matrix can be:
              invited by you, none invited by you or mixed.

              The last 4 contributions of the 5th. line will be used to restart
              the level, with these contributions the same level is activated
              again and 100% of these contributions are transferred to your
