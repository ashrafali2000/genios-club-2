            Each of these two programs, G3X2 and G3X5 have 8 levels. All similar
            and work in the same way. Each subsequent level is 4 times more
            valuable than the previous one. Both programs have an income and a
            profit 4 times bigger than the previous one. How many slots can be
            activated immediately? All sixteen at once if you want! They have no
            expiration date, so you dont have to be afraid that they will stop
            working. All active matrixes move and bring you revenue in parallel
